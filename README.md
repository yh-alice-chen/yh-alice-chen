## Hi I'm Alice. 👋

👧 I'm an experienced Business and Data Analyst and a proud graduate with a postgraduate degree in Business Analysis and Consulting. Driven by a relentless pursuit of precision, a deeply analytical mindset, and the art of critical thinking, I'm fascinated by the intricacies of data and coding, firmly believing in the power of data to unveil stories that inspire and inform.

🔍 My journey is marked by a meticulous attention to detail and a passion for uncovering the hidden narratives within datasets. I thrive on the challenge of transforming complex information into actionable insights, using my skills to bridge the gap between data and decision-making.

💻 Coding is not just a skill for me; it's a form of expression. It's how I bring data to life, turning abstract numbers into stories that resonate. My GitHub is a testament to this passion, a curated collection of practice projects and my own coding adventures. Each project is a chapter in my ongoing story of exploration and achievement.

🌱 I'm a firm believer in continuous self-development, always on the lookout for new knowledge and techniques to refine my craft. My journey is one of perpetual learning, driven by curiosity and a desire to excel.

🤝 I'm here to connect, collaborate, and share. Whether you're interested in discussing data-driven strategies, diving into coding challenges, or simply sharing insights, I welcome your comments and contacts. Let's explore the endless possibilities of data together.
